# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a way to reuse some way to manipulate data. It includes an input, the manipulation, and an output. 
You would want to use a function if you have a number of inputs, and you want to do the same thing to each input. 
You could write a function that receives all these inputs and pumps out the desired output.

#### 2. What is a method?
A method is a function that exists within a class.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
charAt(i), concat(), toUpperCase, toLowerCase are a few examples of js string methods.

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
An accessor method works by manipulating the items within an array and retrieving data while keeping the original array the same. 
You would use an accessor to access information within the array or use the array as a reference.
Meanwhile, a mutator manipulates the items within an array permanently. 
You would use this if you wanted to change the original array into your desired array. 

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() prints out code so that it is visible.
return refers to the output of a function - whatever input goes into the () of a function outputs according to the return line of code.
However, this output is not necessarily visible.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
I really appreciate the pattern of having lectures to establish a lesson and helping us familiarize a concept, 
and then having a lot of time to practice using those concepts in the exercises and challenges. 
The hands-on learning and practice helps me understand the concepts the most, especially playing with and trying different approaches to the challenges.
